What is this?
================

Idavoll is a Jabber publish-subscribe service component, as defined in

build a generic pubsub service, but of which parts can be reused for building
custom pubsub services for specific applications.

Current Status
==============

There are two different backends: one using PostgreSQL for storage, and one
just keeping everything in memory.

In Idavoll the mimimal requirements of JEP-0060 version 1.11 are implemented
plus a number of optional features, as returned by Service Discovery.
